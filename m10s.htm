                <p class="typewriter-text" data-text="I recently covered the Malaya 10's tournament at RRI Sungai Buloh after being booked by a friend to be their official photographer. The team had a special dynamic, consisting mostly of fresh SPM leavers who were desperate to return to the field after sacrificing rugby for their studies. You could feel that they were absolutely itching to play again after such a long hiatus.

The competition was steep, as they were forced to compete against players who were much older and more experienced. However, despite the physical mismatch, the boys showed incredible fighting spirit. They went into every tackle with determination, refusing to be intimidated by the age difference or the size of their opponents."></p>

The true victory was that they finally got to satisfy their craving to play the sport they love. It was less about winning the tournament and more about the sheer joy of being back on the pitch together."></p>
